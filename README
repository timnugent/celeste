Identify clouds in images using support vector machines for enhanced panoramic stitching

(c) Tim Nugent

This repository contains code originally written during Google Summer of Code 2008. It is now tightly integrated with the Hugin code base so to compile it I would recommend checking out Hugin via mecurial from here:

hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/hugin/hugin hugin-hugin

Alternatively, you can modify the Makefile and link to the appropriate libraries.

To re-train the support vector machine model, please see the README and scripts in the training directory.
